IIT Jodhpur Campus Navigation System
DSA Project — Shortest Path using Dijkstra’s Algorithm

  This project implements a Campus Navigation System for IIT Jodhpur using:
  
  C++ (Shortest Path with Dijkstra)
  
  Python (Graph Visualization + Path Highlighting)
  
  Custom IITJ map with real walking distances

Features:

  Takes source and destination as input
    
  Computes shortest walking route
    
  Prints distance + path
    
  Python script displays map with highlighted shortest path
    
  Uses adjacency lists + priority queue
    
  Works on custom IITJ campus graph (B1, G2, LHC1, LHC2, Mess, Library, etc.)

Tech Stack

  C++17
    
  Dijkstra’s Algorithm
    
  Graph Theory (Weighted Undirected Graph)
